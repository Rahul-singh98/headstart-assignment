# HeadStart Assignment

## Requirements

1. Objective:
   Build a sophisticated Python application that scrapes data from the web, processes it, and
   provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the data. This assignment is
   designed to test your deep understanding of Python, web scraping, data manipulation, and
   creating user-friendly CLI applications.

2. Time Limit:
   60 minutes

3. Requirements:

   1. Project Setup -
      Use virtual environments (venv or pipenv) to manage dependencies.
      Create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies.

   2. Web Scraping -
      Scrape data from a website of your choice (e.g., Flipkart , Amazon).
      Use libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, or Scrapy for web scraping.
      Ensure the scraper handles pagination if the website has multiple pages of data.

   3. Data Processing -
      Store the scraped data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, SQLite database).
      Process the data to extract meaningful information (e.g., summarizing headlines, calculating
      average stock prices, etc.).

   4. Command-Line Interface -
      Create a CLI using argparse or click that allows users to interact with the data.

4. Implement the following commands:

   scrape: Scrape the data from the website and store it.

   show: Display the processed data in a user-friendly format.

   search: Search the data based on user input (e.g., search news by keyword, filter stocks by
   date).

   stats: Show statistics about the data (e.g., number of articles, average stock price).

5. Error Handling and Logging -
   Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues (e.g., network errors, invalid
   user input).
   Use the logging module to log important events and errors.

6. Performance Optimization -
   Optimize the scraper to minimize the number of requests and handle large datasets
   efficiently.
   Use techniques like caching to improve performance where applicable.

7. Unit Testing -
   Write unit tests for your data processing functions using unit test or pytest.
   Ensure your tests cover edge cases and potential error scenarios.

8. Bonus (if time permits):
   Implement a feature to export the processed data to an Excel file.
   Add support for multiple data sources and allow users to select the source via the CLI.
   Use a database like SQLite to store the scraped data and allow complex queries via the CLI.
   Implement a feature to visualize the data using a library like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Submission Instructions:
Create a GitHub repository and push your code.
Share the repository link along with a brief README explaining how to run the application,
install dependencies, and use the CLI commands.
